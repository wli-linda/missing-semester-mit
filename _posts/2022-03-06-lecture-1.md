This follows from the content at [Course overview + the shell](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/course-shell/).

## Command Summary
| Command | [Parameters]/[Flags] | Usage |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `<` and `>` | - | redirect to input/output stream |
| `>>` | - | append to file |
| `\|` | - | pipe |
| `curl` | - | - |
| `grep` | `[--ignore-case]` | - |
| `cut` | `--delimiter=' '` | - |
| `touch` | - | - |
| `sh` | - | bash interpreter |
| `chmod` | `[ugoa][+-=][rwxX]` | change mode of file, e.g. `chmod +x example.txt` |
| `#!` ([shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix))) | - | - |


Other basic commands and tips:
* `sudo`
* `$SHELL`
* `$PATH` `which` 
* `date`
* `man` or `--help`
* `cd` `pwd` `ls`
    * variants: `cd -` `cd ..` `ls -l`
* `mkdir` `rmdir`
* `mv` `cp` `rm`
* `echo` `cat`
* `#` for comments
* absolute and relative paths
* [difference between single and double quotes](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Quoting.html)
* can dig up interesting (and potentially dangerous things) from `/sys`
* `C-l` to refresh terminal
* add `&` to end of line to let the preceding command run in the background, e.g. `emacs newfile` vs. `emacs newfile &`

## Exercises
1. `echo $SHELL`

1. Create a new directory called `missing` under `/tmp`.
```bash
$ cd /tmp
$ mkdir missing
```

1. Look up the `touch` program.
```bash
$ man touch
```

1. Use touch to create a new file called `semester` in `missing`.
```bash
$ touch semester
```
Note: **XXX**

1. Write the following into that file, one line at a time: 
```bash
#!/bin/sh
curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu
```
```bash
$ '#!/bin/sh' > semester
$ 'curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu' >> semester
```

1. Try to execute the file, i.e. type the path to the script (`./semester`) into your shell and press enter. Understand why it doesn’t work by consulting the output of `ls` (hint: look at the permission bits of the file).
```bash
$ ./semester
$ ls -l
```

1. Run the command by explicitly starting the `sh` interpreter, and giving it the file semester as the first argument, i.e. `sh semester`. Why does this work, while `./semester` didn’t?

1. Look up the `chmod` program (e.g. use `man chmod`).

1. Use `chmod` to make it possible to run the command `./semester` rather than having to type `sh semester`. How does your shell know that the file is supposed to be interpreted using `sh`? 

1. Use `|` and `>` to write the “last modified” date output by `semester` into a file called `last-modified.txt` in your home directory.

1. Write a command that reads out your laptop battery’s power level or your desktop machine’s CPU temperature from `/sys`.
